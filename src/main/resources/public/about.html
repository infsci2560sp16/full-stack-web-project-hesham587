<h1>Why iBlog?</h1>
<h5>As a student in the Information Security track in the iSchool, I find it difficult to find good resources for information security that are easy to grasp even if you do not have a solid background in the field. Usually, the resources on the web either too advanced or they require to read other material from another resources. This project, iBlog, will act as an intermediate learning resource for those who want to master the information security and do not have a good background.</h5>

<h1>What is special?</h1>
<h5> An individual or a small group usually runs a blog. However, this blog, iBlog, will be more interactive so everyone can create posts or comment on others more openly rather than being managed by an individual. The reason why I want to make it a blog and not a conventional website is that I want users to interact and generate contents more freely without feeling of being judged by experts since this blog will target people who are newly interested in the field of information security. </h5>
